[{"topic":"UNcover API","path":"cennznet.github.io/docs/UNcover/APIendpoints.md","text":"API Endpoints\n\nFor clarity we grouped all endpoints into 5 distinct categories. Each category represents certain type of data that you can retrieve. \n\nblocks  \n\ntransactions \n\naddresses\n\nbalances\n\nassets\n\n\n\nA Block is the basic element of any blockchain. It functions as an entry in a distributed ledger, recording a series of transactions or events together with a reference to the previous block. A block is chained to its preceding block by a cryptographic hash of its contents as a means of reference. Blocks contain an identifier for the final state after all transactions contained in it are validated. \n\nGET /blocks\n\nThis endpoint allows you to retrieve a paginated response of all blocks from across the network. \nRecords are sorted by block number in reverse chronological order (most recent first).\n\nParameters\n\n\n\nExample HTTP request\n\n\n\nExample cURL request\n\n\n\nExample JSON response (200 OK)\n\n\n\nExample JSON response (400 Bad Request)\n\n\n\nGET /blocks/latest\n\nThis endpoint returns data for the latest block in the network. \n\nExample HTTP request\n\n\n\nExample cURL request\n\n\n\nExample JSON response (200 OK)\n\n\n\nGET /blocks/latest/number\n\nThis endpoint returns the latest block number from the network.\n\nExample HTTP request\n\n\n\nExample cURL request\n\n\n\nExample JSON response (200 OK)\n\n\n\nGET /blocks/{id}\n\nThis endpoint allows you to retrieve data for a particular block by specifying either its number or hash. \n\nParameters\n\n\n\nExample HTTP request\n\n\n\nExample cURL request\n\n\n\nExample JSON response (200 OK)\n\n\n\nExample JSON response (400 Bad Request)\n\n\n\nGET /blocks/{id}/transactions\n\nThis endpoint allows you to retrieve a paginated response of all transactions from given block from across the network. You need to specify block either by its number or hash, and transactions (if any) will be shown in an array. Records are ordered by transaction index in  chronological order.\n\nParameters\n\n\n\nExample HTTP request\n\n\n\nExample cURL request\n\n\n\nExample JSON response (200 OK)\n\n\n\nExample JSON response (400 Bad Request)\n\n\n\n\n\nA Transaction is a message between two addresses that may transfer an asset, initiate a contract call or execute a contract (also called internal transaction). Asset transfer or contract transactions always originate from an external address that is controlled by an external actor by means of a private key.\nInternal transactions are result of an execution chain originally triggered by an external address and typically are messages passed between a contract address and any other address (external or contract).\n\nGET /transactions\n\nThis endpoint allows you to retrieve a paginated response of all transactions from across the network. Records are sorted by block number in reverse chronological order (most recent first) and then by index in chronological order.\n\nParameters\n\n\n\nExample HTTP request\n\n\n\nExample cURL request\n\n\n\nExample JSON response (200 OK)\n\n\n\nExample JSON response (400 Bad Request)\n\n\n\nGET /transactions/{hash}\n\nThis endpoint allows you to retrieve transaction data by specifying its hash. You will get either standard or contract type of transactions.\n\nParameters\n\n\n\nExample HTTP request\n\n\n\nExample cURL request\n\n\n\nExample JSON response (200 OK)\n\n\n\nExample JSON response (400 Bad Request)\n\n\n\nGET /transactions/{hash}/internal\n\nThis endpoint allows you to retrieve all internal transactions by specifying parent transaction hash (i.e. contract transaction type). Note that both contract and internal transaction share the same hash. Result is sorted by index in chronological order.\n\nParameters\n\n\n\nExample HTTP request\n\n\n\nExample cURL request\n\n\n\nExample JSON response (200 OK)\n\n\n\nExample JSON response (400 Bad Request)\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Address is base-58 encoded value that can identify a specific account on the chain. It can be either external (controlled by an external actor by means of a private key) or contract address. \n\nGET /addresses/{address}/transactions\n\nThis endpoint allows you to retrieve a paginated response with all transactions for a given address. You may include optional parameters like asset ID or transaction flow to narrow down your result set. Result is sorted by block number in reverse chronological order (most recent first) and then by transaction index in chronological order. \n\nParameters\n\n\n\nExample HTTP request\n\n\n\nExample cURL request\n\n\n\nExample JSON response (200 OK)\n\n\n\nExample JSON response (400 Bad Request)\n\n\n\n\n\nA Balance is addresses' value of an asset at given block (point in time). It gets updated with any transaction or event associated with a given address. \n\nGET /balances/{address}/latest\n\nThis endpoint allows you to retrieve the most recent balances for a given address, break down by asset ID and block number. Result is sorted by asset ID in chronological order.\n\nParameters\n\n\n\nExample HTTP request\n\n\n\nExample cURL request\n\n\n\nExample JSON response (200 OK)\n\n\n\nExample JSON response (400 Bad Request)\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Asset is a digital token which can be transferred between addresses and has defined function within blockchain ecosystem (e.g. can serve as means of staking or paying transfer fees).\n\nGET /assets\n\nThis endpoint allows you to retrieve a paginated response with general asset information. \n\nParameters\n\n\n\nExample HTTP request\n\n\n\nExample cURL request\n\n\n\nExample JSON response (200 OK)\n\n\n"},{"topic":"UNcover API","path":"cennznet.github.io/docs/UNcover/FAQ.md","text":"Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n\nWhat is UNcover?\n\n      UNcover is an explorer tool that is used in searching the blockchain for transactions, accounts, assets and other activities on chain.
