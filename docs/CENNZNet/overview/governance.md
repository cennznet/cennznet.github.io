# Governance (Coming Soon)
CENNZ holders have the right to propose motions for CENNZnet and the voting power to approve or disapprove the motions. Motions are executable on chain, for example, a motion can be a proposal to increase maximum number of validators and upon approval the change will be made on chain automatically after certain cool-down period. 

The proposed motions will be put into a referendum, where your voting power is determined by the CENNZ bonded to the proposal and the duration you are willing to lock those CENNZ upon winning. A cool-down period, during which winning voters' CENNZ are locked before a motion, is enacted can avoid irresponsible votes carrying bad proposals.

The council is a delegated group for decision making. Anyone with CENNZ can bond their CENNZ and be elected as council member for a certain period of time. 

More details are coming soon as we finalise the governance process.
