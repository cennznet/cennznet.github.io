#### Packed with human-readable data
Most block explorers are full of data which is confusing at first, especially when you are new to blockchain space.  
To reduce the cognitive bias we made an effort to present the data in a format that most of us is already familiar with.  
You will see information in high level fashion, tabulated with just highlights of important stuff, as well as drilled down to more detailed overview.  
What is really cool though is the overview with banking-like look & feel - where transactions and events are presented in a logical and understandable manner.

#### Many uses
Observe blocks as they come in (near) real-time fashion.  
Go back and forth in time with tracking transactions, asset allocations and transfers as well as balances for any account.   
Plug your DApp and track smart contract (runtime module) execution and outcomes.  
Check stats and visualizations to better understand   
Any many more!
