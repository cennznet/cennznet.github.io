 executed and any value will be transferred.
 
 * If the account is a regular account, any value will be transferred.
 
 * If no account exists and the call value is not less than `existential_deposit`,
 
 a regular account will be created and any value will be transferred.

 Creation is executed as follows:
 

 
 - The destination address is computed based on the sender and hash of the code.
 
 - The smart-contract account is created at the computed address.
 
 - The `ctor_code` is executed in the context of the newly-created account. Buffer returned
 
   after the execution is saved as the `code` of the account. That code will be invoked
 
   upon any call received by this account.
 
 - The contract is initialized.
